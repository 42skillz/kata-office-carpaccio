Instructions for the Elephant Carpaccio kata (Thomas' version of Elephant Carpaccio Alistair Cockburn kata, but inspired by the Office tv series)

[Some details on how we did it the first time:](https://twitter.com/tpierrain/status/1126416897849819136?s=20)

## Instructions

1. Welcome people and ask them to add stickies (or paper) with their name (__1 minute__)
   - Tell them that they will have to work in pair or mob (sub groups) afterwards

1. Ask them a question (written on the white board): "*What is the value of splitting stories very small?*"
   - Give them __3 minutes to write down ideas on stickies__ 
   - Take __5 minutes to review all of them__
   - Take another __5 minutes to debrief and present Alistair's value curves__

1. Let them ask you some questions about the instructions for __5 minutes__

1. Give them 20 minutes in order to break-down the backlog into 5 iterations of 8 minutes

1. __*"Sorry, we've changed our mind and"*__: If they didn't ask you questions about some missing parts, interrupt them after 7 minutes with a breaking news: 
    - "Sorry, we've changed our mind and we've decided to target the US first. Thus, you can forget France, Italy, Spain and Poland regions and follow the rules in this addendum to the specifications
    - We've also decided to change our discouting strategy. Instead of applying a discount depending on the number of paper reams, we want to apply a discount based on the total free-of-tax price as mentionned in the addendum

1. Tell them they will have 10 more minutes to break-down the backlog into 5 iterations.

1. Gather them one last time before they start coding and clarifies whatever it takes. 
   - Then tell them they will have 5 iterations of 8 minutes, with a possible demo for you (the PO) every end of it.
   - Also tell them that the stopwatch won't stop between all these iterations

1. Gather them for the final wrap-up
