Instructions for the Elephant Carpaccio kata (Thomas' version of Elephant Carpaccio Alistair Cockburn kata, but inspired by the Office tv series)

[Some details on how we did it the first time:](https://twitter.com/tpierrain/status/1126416897849819136?s=20)

## Instructions

1. Welcome people and ask them to add stickies (or paper) with their name (__1 minute__)
   - Tell them that they will have to work in pair or mob (sub groups) afterwards

1. Ask them a question (written on the white board): "*What is the value of splitting stories very small?*"
   - Give them __3 minutes to write down ideas on stickies__ 
   - Take __5 minutes to review all of them__
   - Take another __5 minutes to debrief and present Alistair's value curves__

1. Take __5 minutes to explain the audience__ that they:
    - Will have 20 minutes to write on paper 10-20 demo-able stories (slices) and to break-down them into 5 iterations (actually you will let them 10 more minutes for this analysis part, as explained further)
    - Will have 40 minutes in order to build an app for you in 5 iterations of 8 minutes (pairing or mobbing)
    
1. Gives them the following instructions and __10 minutes to read them carefully__

1. Let them ask you some questions about the instructions for __5 minutes__ and ask them to work in small group as of now

1. Give them __20 minutes__ in order to do the analysis and slicing of tiny and demo-able user stories (slices)

1. *"BREAKING-NEWS EVERYONE! Sorry, we've changed our mind and..."*: __After 7 minutes__, interrupt all of them with a breaking news (but you can tell other groups before if they came to you with questions): 
    - "Sorry, we've changed our mind and we've decided to target the US first. Thus, you can forget France, Italy, Spain and Poland regions and follow the rules in this addendum to the specifications
    - We've also decided to change our discounting strategy. Instead of applying a discount depending on the number of paper reams, we want to apply a discount based on the total free-of-tax price as mentionned in the addendum

1. Tell them __they will have 10 more minutes__ to slice their stories and break-down them into 5 iterations

1. Gather them one last time before they start coding and clarifies whatever it takes. 
   - Then tell them they will have 5 iterations of 8 minutes, with a possible demo for you (the PO) every end of it.
   - Also tell them that the stopwatch won't stop between all these iterations

1. __5 iterations of 8 minutes__ (don't forget to trigger the stopwatch every time)

1. Gather them for the final wrap-up (__15 minutes__)
